# Project-3 -- List It

## Description:

This is not just any shopping list, this shopping list is also a MERN PWA and is downloadable to your mobile and computer devices. This application is fast, reliable, and works offline. Dynamic frontend created with React.
// COME BACK TO THIS AND WRITE MORE!

## User Setup: // need to udpate!

To use this at home, in your terminal run the following commands to invoke the application:
`npm i` to install packages,
then `npm run start` starts the live server.

## User Story

```md
AS A shopper
I WANT to create a shopping list that I can share with others with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve for later use at the supermarket
```
